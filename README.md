# DMZ Protection Policy

The DMZ environment is isolated from unauthorized external access through firewall filtering and segmentation policies.

External public hosts are restricted from directly accessing protected internal services located in the DMZ segment.

## Security Controls

- Border firewall filtering
- DMZ segmentation
- Controlled inbound access
- Internal resource isolation
- Restricted Internet-originated communication

## Security Validation

- External hosts cannot directly access DMZ resources
- Internet-originated ICMP blocked toward protected segments
- Internal services remain isolated from public networks

---

# External Connectivity Validation

The infrastructure successfully provides controlled external connectivity to public services on the Internet.

Internal hosts are capable of reaching external networks through the enterprise edge infrastructure and WAN routing configuration.

## Connectivity Validation

- Successful ICMP communication to external public servers
- Internet reachability through redundant ISP architecture
- Internal-to-external traffic routing operational
- WAN routing functioning correctly

### Google Connectivity Test

The following test demonstrates successful communication between an internal workstation and an external public server.
